## Currently researching how to implement visualizations for various audio features
#### There seems to not be that many resources online. So maybe I can create my own library for myself and others to use.
My main goal with this project is extract all possible useful information about a song, sample, or anything else that can be represented within an audio file.
I have not found any valid, up to date, WORKING, spectrogram libraries or key finders. I believe that I can manipulate the FFT and Zero Crossing Rate of the audioBuffer
in order find real-time and post-time scales of songs. Shazam doesn't seem to offer public use of it's API, so I could try to build my own song detector. I also figure I need to check out Spotify's API, since it has a lot of features.








# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
